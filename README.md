# Task-Planner

## What is this?

This repo provides the platform to organise tasks to do, in progress, up for review and completed.

## Why we used the technologies we used:

We used HTML, CSS & Bootstrap to enable flexibility to manipulate our layout and form structure. Some of the challenges we faced and features we hoped to implement in the future was learning to adjust the padding for our footer and the steps of the range slide bar.

## How to use this project:

We have implemented a modal. This allows a new task item to be logged with details including the name, description, assigned to, due date and person assigned to.

The data from the modal is then reflected on the layout page where cards are displaying an outline of each task.

The future goal will be to assign the cards to columns to tally the "to do" vs the "done".
